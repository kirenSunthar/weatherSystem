# WeatherSystem
This is the Weather System designed for Software Engineering Project Assignment 1


1. Clone the GitHub repository containing the weather system code onto your local machine.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository.

3. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. The weather system has been developed using Python version 3.7, so ensure that you have this or a compatible version installed.

3. Install the required dependencies for the weather system by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
** For java, install the 

4. Launch the weather system by running the following command: python weather_system.py

5. Once the system has launched, you will be prompted to enter a country name and a month of the year. Enter these details as requested and press Enter.

6. The system will display the season in the country based on the month entered.

7. To check whether the temperature in a country is hot or cold, enter the country name followed by the temperature separated by a comma. For example, "USA, 25" will display "USA is hot".

***For running code in Java***
1. To run a Java program, you need to use the java command in the terminal or command prompt. Here are the steps to run a Java program:

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

3. Navigate to the directory where the Java program is located using the cd command.

4. Compile the Java program using the javac command followed by the name of the Java file. For example, if the Java file is named HelloWorld.java, you would type the following command:

javac HelloWorld.java


***Weather System***>
*This system allows users to enter a country name and month of the year and display the season in the country. It also allows users to enter a temperature and display whether the country is hot or cold.*

Once the system has launched, follow the on-screen prompts to enter the country name and month of the year. The system will display the season in the country based on the month entered. To check whether the temperature in a country is hot or cold, enter the country name followed by the temperature separated by a comma.
