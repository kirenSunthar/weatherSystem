This is the Weather System designed for Software Engineering Project Assignment 1


1. Clone the GitHub repository containing the weather system code onto your local machine.

Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository.

Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. The weather system has been developed using Python version 3.7, so ensure that you have this or a compatible version installed.

Install the required dependencies for the weather system by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the weather system by running the following command: python weather_system.py

Once the system has launched, you will be prompted to enter a country name and a month of the year. Enter these details as requested and press Enter.

The system will display the season in the country based on the month entered.

To check whether the temperature in a country is hot or cold, enter the country name followed by the temperature separated by a comma. For example, "USA, 25" will display "USA is hot".
